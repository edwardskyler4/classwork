                    Spaceflight will never tolerate carelessness, incapacity, and neglect. Somewhere, somehow, we screwed up. It could have been in design, build, or test. Whatever it was, we should have caught it. We were too gung ho about the schedule and we locked out all of the problems we saw each day in our work.

                    I believe that we can give our middle class relief and provide working families with a road to opportunity. So doing the Lord's work is a thread that's run through our politics since the very beginning. But the remarks that have caused this recent firestorm weren't simply controversial. Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill. I am emphasizing such investments within my country. Some suggest that it isn't worth the effort - that we are fated to disagree, and civilizations are doomed to clash.
