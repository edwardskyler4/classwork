CSE 111 Proposal for a Student Chosen Program

1. What is the title of your program?
    My program is going to be called "my_plant_helper.py".


2. What real-world problem will your program address or help to solve?
    It's design is to send the user a reminder when it's time to water their plants.


3. What will you learn from developing this program?
    I'm going to learn how to make a simple GUI, how to push notifications, and how to use classes, especially if I have time to add a feature where users can input their individual plant types. I'll also be able to learn how to have a program run in the background, making it automatically update and notify me at appropriate times.


4. What Python modules will your program use?
    I'm going to use tkinter, datetime, platform, and some notification modules to use depending on the computer system being used (pync, plyer, subprocess).


5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each
perform a single task?
    Yes, I will.


6. Will you write test functions to test at least two of your program
functions?
    Yes, I will.
